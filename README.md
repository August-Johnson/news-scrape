# WEEK 19 - NEWS SCRAPER

<p>This week’s assignment was to create a ‘News Scraper’ app that scrapes a news site of our choice. I chose the New York Times world news page. The application is able to scrape new articles with the press of a button, allow users to save articles and add multiple notes to each saved article in their collection.</p>
